# Exploring Instagram’s Top 100 Influencers with Gephi: Social Network Analysis & Community Mapping
This project provides an in-depth analysis and visualization of Instagram's social network structure by leveraging data collected from popular Instagram accounts and their followers. Using network analysis techniques, this project maps relationships, detects communities, and uncovers influential nodes within the Instagram ecosystem. It utilizes Gephi for visualization and Python for data processing, with the potential to integrate machine learning for deeper insights.

Instructions:
Please, check readme.txt files for instruction on how to use this software:
There are 2 folder manual scrape and auto scraper

Manual Scraper does the same way I showed in the youtube video

Auto Scraper does it automatically, but I recommend to not overuse it, as your account may be blocked by Instagram.

Open the file “instagram-analysis.gephi” on Gephi to open this graph project.
